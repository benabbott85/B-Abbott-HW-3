This assignment functions in the following way. When opening the page you will be brought to the main screen of the password generator. The generate password button will be able to be clicked on while the copy to clipboard will be grayed out at this point. Once you click on generate password it will take you first through a prompt asking how many characters you want the password to be. Next up, will be a series of confirm statements asking what you would like the password to contain from the established arrays in the js file up top. Once all confirm questions have been answered it will spit out a password that is able to be copied to the clipboard and for the user to do what they want with it.

# B-Abbott-HW-3

For this homework ran into some issues with formatting and ordering of functions/if statements and also when to call them. I had two meetings with my tutor this week that definitely helped me get anywhere close to what the finished product is that I have submitted. I need to do some work on the the concepts covered in class this week.
